== Problems

=== Camunda

- No JNDI support in quarkus
.. Datasource must be passed to engine which is only accessible via injection
- The rest path has been changed recently in camunda:
.. Old: http://localhost:8080/rest/engine/default/process-definition/key/todo/start
.. New: http://localhost:8080/engine-rest/engine/default/process-definition/key/todo/start

=== Kogito

----
Fire rule limit reached 10000, limit can be set via system property org.jbpm.rule.task.firelimit or via data input of business rule task named FireRuleLimit
----

This basically means there is a loop in a rule and it is called repetitively.
